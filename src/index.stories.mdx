ProtoChakra is a Less Code (building with comprehansive and composed elements) & opinionated components and utils library based on Chakra UI and created with React. We
created the library for our internal use at MVR Studio, but we wanted to share it with everyone. It extends current
Chakra UI possibilities (as we love Chakra) and enriches it, so everyone using Chakra UI and
ProtoChakra can build Prooves of Concepts, MVPs and Prototypes faster and better.
